Punkorgan is a very simple additive synth, based on church/Hammond organ.
- It has drawbars.
- Polyphonic. (10)
- Leslie effect (freq modulation)
- Echo effect
- Volume/overdrive
- Key play
- Slider play (just for fun, chord)

The algorithm was designed to implement later in Atmega microcontrollers. Arduino, yes. Later.
