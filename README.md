# Z+nth

A Z + n 'th totally unnecessary software synthesizer project only for my own (others?) entertainment. For a change, this one written in C#, and runs only on Windows.

You will need Naudio for compile. Use Nuget to obtain it. Maybe it will do it for you automatically, i dont know.

Compile, and run PunkOrgan.
Shred as you wish with the sliders.
If the sound is too bad, give more latency. By the way, it should work by default, with any computer manufactured after 2010.

You can use keys to play too. Unfortunatelly currently only qwertz works fine. I did'nt figured yet out how to do it right with WPF.

Maybe other PunkSynths coming soon, as I have mood and time.
